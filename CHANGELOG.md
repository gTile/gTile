CHANGE LOG
----------
### 60
- New setting "auto-snap-window"
  - When enabled, gTile automatically offers the focused window to be aligned to the current grid in a "snap-to-grid" fashion.
- Maintenance: Fixed typo in settings (#377), add functional tests, and upgrade dependencies

### 59
- Add support for Gnome 46 (extension is compatible without further code changes)

### 58
- Overhauled gTile overlay placement logic
  - Restored old placement behavior.
  - The gTile overlay is now placed in the center of the currently focused window by default.
  - The gTile overlay is now hidden/closed when the Gnome workspace overview (<kbd>Super</kbd>-key) is activated.
  - A new setting allows to toggle between new and old placement modes, i.e., "at cursor" or "within the focused window".

### 57
Breaking change:

- Permanently removed/renamed `dconf` setting keys `resize-left`, `resize-up`, `resize-right`, `resize-down`.
- Users that assigned custom shortcuts for interactively resizing windows must re-assign these shortcuts in the preference dialog.

New and changed functionality:

- Allow interactive window resizing in all directions via keybindings (#369, see breaking changes!).
- The keybinding dialog now also works on X11 (#363)
- Minimized windows are now properly ignored when using the autotile feature.
- Builds no longer requires the `compilerOptions.skipLibCheck` build option.

### 56
- Fix #361: gnome-shell process froze due to an allocation size overflow when changing the grid size list in the extension preferences.

### 55
- Satisfy non-functional requirements to be publishable on extensions.gnome.org.

### 54

Breaking change:

New and changed functionality:

- Tile coordinates can be specified from right (down) edge by using negative nubmer, i.e. -3:-1 -4:-2
- Tile coordinates can be specified as float in range 0.0 .. 1.0, prefixed by "~", i.e. ~0.1:~0.2 ~0.5:~0.6
- All styles of tile coordinates can be mixed and matched, i.e. 2:-3 ~0.5:-1
- Fixed rounding error for shortcuts window placement
