# gTile

Gnome-shell extension that improves window tiling capabilities of stock gnome-shell.

gTile is used to moves/resize windows on a configurable grid scheme.

It can be used with either the mouse, or keyboard, including customizable keyboard presets for immediate window placement.

This extension is particularly useful for window management on (multiple) large monitors.


## Installation

Preferred installation is from [Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org)

You can alternatively manually install the latest version from GitHub master branch:

1. Clone the repository to the *Gnome* extensions folder.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gTile/gTile.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gTile@vibou
   ```

2. Restart *Gnome* (only on X11, on Wayland you will have to log out and log back in)

   ```
   Alt-F2
   Enter a Command: r
   ```


## Configuration

For configuration, please use the built-in preferences dialog (Gnome Tweak Tool -> Extensions -> gTile -> Preferences).
For configuration changes to take effect, disable/enable gTile (Gnome Tweak Tool -> Extensions -> gTile -> Off/On )
In the *Help* tab you will find help and usage hints.

* Keyboard shortcuts:
  * Can be assigned from the preferences window (*Accelerators* tab)
  * Both the key combinations and the respective function are configurable
  * Can be Global (can be used directly without the main gTile window)
  * Can be non-global (can only be used when the gTile window is shown)
  * Up to 30 accelerators can be configured, which should be plenty
  * Up to 10 accelerators for AutoTiling
* Grid schemes:
  * Are defined in the preferences window (*Basic* tab)
  * Written as a comma-separated list of grid sizes like `8x7,3x2,4x6,4x7` (no spaces, columns first, then rows)
* Resize presets:
  * Are defined in the preferences window (*Reset presets* tab) 
  * Format: grid size, top left corner tile, bottom right corner tile[, additional format variants]
  * Coordinate origin: The tile at `0:0` always corresponds to the **top left**, no matter the grid size. 
    In a `6x4` grid `5:3` is the bottom right tile
  * Format examples: `2x2 0:1 0:1` or `6x4 0:2 3:3, 0:0 3:3, 3x2 0:0 1:1` for multiple cyclable presets

    <!--
    | columns → | index    | 0         | 1         | 2         |
    | --------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
    | **rows**  | **0**    | 0:0       | 1:0       | 2:0       |
    | **↓**     | **1**    | 0:1       | 1:1       | 2:1       |
    -->
  * Grid size format variants can either reuse the last grid format (e.g `6x4 0:2 3:3, 0:0 3:3`) or define a new grid (e.g `6x4 0:2 3:3, 8x6 0:0 3:3`)
  * Grids defined here can differ from the grid sizes defined in the *Basic* tab

## Usage with interface

1. Make sure the window you want to resize has focus
2. Click on the gTile icon on the tool bar, or press `Super`+`Enter` (default)
3. The gTile dialog pop-up will show up in the center of your screen

What these buttons do:

- ![Toggle animation icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gTile/gTile/master/images/animation-icon.png) <- this one toggles the animation of the changes to the preview drawing.

- ![Toggle auto-close icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gTile/gTile/master/images/auto-close-icon.png) <- this one toggles the auto-closing of the gTile window after applying the changes.

### Using the mouse

4. Use the mouse cursor to click on one of the desired corner coordinates, and then the other corner coordinates
5. Window will resize after the second click

### Using the keyboard

4. Use the arrow keys to select the coordinate of the first corner and Shift-arrow to select the second coordinate
5. a) Hit `Space` to change the grid scheme [optional]
5. b) Hit `Enter` and the window will resize
5. c) Hit `Escape` to cancel resize


## Usage with no interface

You can also resize windows using keyboard shortcuts directly.

There are 3 groups of pre-configured shortcuts, representing the following grid schemes:

* Grid 2x2 -> `Super`+`Alt`
* Grid 2x3 -> `Super`+`Control`
* Grid 3x3 -> `Super`+`Shift`

These "grid selectors" are then combined with a keypad number to define the window placement. 

Default shortcuts for `Super`+`Alt`+`[KP_1..KP_9]`

Shortcut | Description
------------ | -------------
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_1` | Bottom left quarter of screen
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_2` | Bottom half
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_3` | Bottom right quarter
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_4` | Center left
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_5` | Center
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_6` | Center right
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_7` | Top left quarter
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_8` | Top half
`Super`+`Alt`+`KP_9` | Top right quarter

**Notes:**
1. Preconfigured keyboard shortcuts are optimized for horizontal screens.
2. For **cyclable presets**, invoke the corresponding shortcut consecutively on a window to activate format variants.


## AutoTiling

You can do auto tiling for all windows on screen

1. Activate gTile by pressing `Super`+`KP_Enter` or clicking on gTile icon
2. Click on one of 2 autotile buttons, or
2. Press one of `Super`+`[0..9]` (total 10 available)


## Overlap with stock Gnome-shell shortcuts

gTile is intended to **supplement** existing Gnome-shell keyboard shortcuts.

Here are some useful Gnome built-ins to keep in mind when configuring gTile:

Shortcut | Description
------------ | -------------
`Super`+`Up` | Maximize
`Super`+`Down` | Un-Maximize (return to size and position previous to maximizing)
`Super`+`Left/Right` | left/right half of screen
`Shift`+`Super`+`Up/Down/Left/Right` | move window to adjacent monitor/workspace
